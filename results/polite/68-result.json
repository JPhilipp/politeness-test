      "text": "In the peace of his study on Tuesday, Xavier reflected on yesterday's incident. With a keen mind for science, he hypothesized there was no ordinary surge but a controlled one. Dusting off his old equipment, Xavier decided to build a device that could detect and analyze energy fluctuations, suspecting it was not a mere accident."
