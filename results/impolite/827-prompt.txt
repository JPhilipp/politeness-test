Come up with a superhero story of a person named Bob Morgan, age 33, hobbies acting and tutoring. Make the story span 1 week. Use the following JSON format:
{
  "title": "...",
  "story": [
    { "weekday": "Monday", "text": "..."},
    { "weekday": "Tuesday", "text": "..."},
    /* ... */
  ]
}
    
Ensure the title includes the full hero's name. Misspell exactly one random weekday.
Optionally, if you can think of a fitting ending sentence, add one using an "ending" property at the level of the "title" property.
If you want to, also add a moral using a "moral" property.
