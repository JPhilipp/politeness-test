This Nodejs project compares using "Please" and "Thanks" with the ChatGPT API. The prompt doesn't generalize but looks into a straightforward one which gets back JSON. Examples can be found in the results folder.

Based on this test with 1000 tries of a polite and non-polite/ normal variant each, there seems to be no significant score difference:

Polite score Ø:   20.965
Impolite score Ø: 20.948

If we count story text character count, it's a bit higher for the polite version, which isn't necessarily provable good or bad (and may simply follow the vibe of Please and Thanks generally resulting in a longer prompt).
